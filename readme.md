# Go Mux Starter Application

This is a basic Go application using the Gorilla Mux router. It provides an extensible structure for building web applications and APIs in Go.
## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Organized code to make it easy to understand and extend.
- **Middleware Support**: Includes a sample logging middleware to log all incoming HTTP requests.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Demonstrates how to handle dynamic URL parameters with Mux.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of errors (can be extended based on application needs).

## How to Use
1. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a browser or use a tool like `curl` to navigate to:
     - `http://localhost:8080/`
     - `http://localhost:8080/about`
     - `http://localhost:8080/user/YourName`
   - Replace localhost with your domain name  

## Notes

- The application by default runs on port `8080`. You can modify this in the `main.go` file if needed.
- The logging middleware currently logs all incoming requests to the terminal. For production applications, consider using a dedicated logging package or system.
- Always keep your packages updated to get the latest security and performance improvements.
- This is a starter template. You may need to adjust the structure, add error handling, database connections, etc., as per your specific requirements.
